Time goes so fast... we have to be ready because the baby could be born any time right now! Just one note: the date set by the gynecologist is July the 3rd (that's why this day has been marked differently). Nevertheless, babys usually born on the day D only on 4% of cases. It could happen before, far before or after July 3rd, but not much later, because in this situation the gynecologist and the all medical team will kindly invite our baby to get out from mommy's belly.<br/><br/><b>Baby's gender:</b> there are only three basic and fundamental options: Boy and Girl, around 50% each; and Pokemon: these creatures are everywhere around Julen and Aria, so anything can happen!",
